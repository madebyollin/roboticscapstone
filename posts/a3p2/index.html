    <h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
    <main>
        <h2>Per-Person Designations:</h2>
        <p>We have distributed the roles based on the interests of each member. Most of the roles will be shared by two members or more, where their knowledge can be complementary. In some cases one of the members will be more experienced which will help
            the second member expand their knowledge.</p>

                <td>The leading roles for ROS programming, they will understand all the basics of ROS, and they will commit the codes. They need to effectively communicate with the other members, especially the user interface and perception gurus.

        <h2>Strategies For Balancing Learning Goals:</h2>
        <p>All members of the team are interested in learning ROS, therefore they will all participate in the ROS programming part; the ROS gurus will be there to guide and help them. This way we will ensure that all members learn ROS.</p>
        <p>The team roles will still be flexible along the weeks, if one member wants to work more in-depth on another part.</p>
