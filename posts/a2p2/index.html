    <h2>Sketch, Storyboard, Environmental Modifications and Capabilities</h2>
    <main>
        <h2>Sketch:</h2>
        <img src="sketch.jpg" />
        <h2>Storyboard:</h2>

        <h2>Environmental Modifications</h2>
        <p>Our bot does not require substantial environmental modifications.  However, it has the following environmental <strong>requirements</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An indoor environment with smooth, robot-navigable flooring</li>
            <li>A pre-computed, labeled floor plan that can be cross-referenced for localization and path planning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technical Capabilities</h2>
        <p>To be feasible, our bot will require the following capabilities to be implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Path finding (using building plans and room locations)</li>
            <li>Localization</li>
            <li>Obstacle avoidance (recognizing people and objects along the way and changing path to avoid them)</li>
            <li>Voice interface (to process vocal commands from the user)</li>
            <li>Hand interface (to communicate with the user and lead them to their destination)</li>
            <li><strong>(Optional)</strong>: Face recognition (To match users with photos of people participating to the conference?)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Company Name and Logo</h2>
        <p>We went through several iterations on the logo (and may do more in the future!).</p>
        <img src="logo_progression.jpg" />
        <p>Our company name is <strong>Aâ€¢Robotics</strong> (Long-form: Accessibility Robotics), representing our focus on improving accessibility through the use of robotics technology.</p>
