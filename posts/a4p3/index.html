        <p>In this video, the user uses the web-based RViz interface to create and name new locations in the map. They can then send the robot to any named location by clicking on the corresponding « Go To » button. The robot will then go to that location. For example, in the video, we go from the location "kitchen" to the location "bedroom", and then to "bathroom".  </p>

        <p>The user has the ability to delete a pose in the list, or change that pose's location by dragging the interactive marker around the map.  Markers can be used to control both position (by dragging the arrow) and rotation (by dragging the surrounding ring).  The markers and their positions are synchronized across browser windows (and with RViz) by publishing new poses for the interactive markers whenever the user finishes dragging.</p>
