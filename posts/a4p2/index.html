        <p>This video demonstrates the use of our command line interface for robot navigation.  We can add the robot's current pose, list saved poses, delete saved poses, and navigate to specified poses by name.  In our demonstration, the current location of the robot (pose 1) is saved. Another location in the map is created and the robot is sent to it. The second location is saved and named (pose 2), the robot is then driven to the initial location, and finally the robot is moved back and forth between the two locations.</p>
