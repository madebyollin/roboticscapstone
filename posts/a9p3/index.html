    <h2>Course Evaluations and Feedback</h2>
    <main>
        <h2>Most Fun</h2>
        <p>We got some more experience with pair programming!  Seeing our code run on the robot was also fun (if a bit scary).</p>
        <h2>Most Useful</h2>
        <p>The parts of the labs where we learned to use APIs were great!  Having access to the robot was nice as wellâ€“and we appreciated having a calendar to schedule it.</p>
        <h2>Not-so-useful</h2>
        <p>It would have been nice to have more time to work on things.</p>
        <h2>Would-Have-Been-Useful-but-Missing</h2>
        <p>The labs took up a lot of time (although we learned a lot).  Either having a pre-requisite seminar (as previously discussed) or compressing the labs (maybe with full-size versions as optional resources) would have been helpful.  Would also have been nice to have VS code or something preinstalled on the computers (we spent a lot of time using vim/gedit before it occurred to us to install VS code).  Maybe a labeled version of the controller (or a diagram somewhere)?</p>
        <p>Also, one robot per group would be cool if we had infinite budget ðŸ¤–</p>
