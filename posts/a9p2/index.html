    <h1>Blog Post #9 Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Team Evaluations and Reflection</h2>
    <main>
        <h2>Strategies that we Adopted</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Team members had roles as defined on our original blog post.</li>
            <li>We split up work across multiple pairs at separate times (rather than trying to have 5 people work at the same computer).</li>
            <li>We took notes on paper about commands to launch (since there are a lot of them).</li>
            <li>We used Slack for group information sharing and question answering.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Strategy Outcomes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We mostly followed the roles listed, with some minor changes.  Kennan worked on UI instead of perception (since we was already working on the iOS app).  It was useful to have defined areas to focus on.</li>
            <li>Splitting up work across teams and times allowed us to minimize idle time (since we didn't have lots of people waiting for the keyboard). The downside was that sometimes we duplicated work, since each team sometimes had to rediscover things separately.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, we probably should have taken notes on our wiki or something. We did this occasionally but didn't centralize these notes.</li>
            <li>Slack was very useful–we were able to fix several bugs this way!</li>
        </ol>
