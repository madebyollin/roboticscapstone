        <!-- SECOND PROJECT -->

        <h2>Tennis Ball Robot:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://bow-tie-bot.tumblr.com/post/169670407189/storyboard">Sketch &amp; Storyboard</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://bow-tie-bot.tumblr.com/post/169669228609/lean-canvas">Lean Canvas</a></p>

        <h3>What do we like about the project?</h3>
        <p>The robot will solve a time and effort problem that is faced in tennis training schools, where players or employees are spending too much time and energy picking up the balls during the training.</p>
        <p>The storyboard demonstrated that purpose very well. It was clear and easy to understand. </p>

        <h3>What are potential issues with the project?</h3>
        <p>The Lean canvas mentions this project as the first in the field, but there are <a href="http://www.tennibot.com/" target="_blank">existing similar products</a> that are being commercialized. However, this is a good indicator of the existence of an established market for this product.</p>
        <p>Object recognition and localization can be challenging to implement, especially if the robot has to do the object localization for the whole court at once. </p>
        <p>Removing the tennis net is not necessary, since the process can be repeated for each side of the court, which will reduce the human intervention needed.</p>
        <p>People can interfere with the recognition and localization process if the court is not empty.</p>
        <p>The carried basket may represent some challenges, it needs to be big enough to hold a large number of balls. Because of its weight, it needs to be attached tightly enough to the robot, and at the same time be flexible enough for the robot to empty it or just replace it with an empty basket.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions to Resolve Issues</h3>
        <p>The object recognition can be continuous where the robot keeps looking for the balls that were not initially localized.</p>
        <p>The carried basket can be mounted on wheels and replaced by an empty basket each time it is full or all the balls have been collected.</p>
