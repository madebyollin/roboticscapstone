        <h2>Cleaning Robot:</h2>

        <h3>What do we like about the project?</h3>
        <p>This project seems like it could be very useful and practical, since every restaurant has the problem of needing to clean its tables.</p>
        <p>I like how specific your project is; I know exactly what you’re trying to build after reading your canvas/sketches.</p>
        <p>I think you do a good job of identifying all the main technical components (vision recognition, edge detection, etc.); I can’t think of anything you missed.</p>
        <p>Partnering with the university seems like a good way to test the robot and get it some exposure.</p>
        <h3>What are potential issues with the project?</h3>
        <p>There are some things that I don’t think I would like as a patron of the restaurant. Namely, I wouldn’t want to be responsible for marking that I was “done” with a table. Also, would there always be a trash can hanging off the edge of the table, or would the robot put that there before it sweeps? I wouldn’t want the former.</p>
        <p>I don’t think that a $4000/month rental would be very appealing to a restaurant. Most restaurants don’t have a full-time janitor cleaning the tables; the staff (waiters, busboys, front-counter workers, etc.) clean it, often when there aren’t many customers in the restaurant and they don’t have anything else to work on. I used to manage shifts at a restaurant and the GM would get mad at me if labor costs were $50 over target on a day; this bot would cost over $125 in “labor” per day despite not having nearly as many skills as a part-time employee. Also, what if someone doesn’t pay one month? Do you have to send a crew out to collect the robot from the restaurant?</p>

        <h3>Suggestions to Resolve Issues</h3>
        <p>Use image recognition or manual commands to know which tables to clean instead of asking the customer to tell the robot to clean up.</p>
        <p>I think a single-purchase model would be better than a subscription model. That way you could market it as a robot that makes your staff’s jobs easier and ensures that the tables are always clean instead of marketing it as an excuse to fire your hard-working janitor.</p>
        <p>I think it’s important to emphasize that the wait staff or the customers still have to clear all the plates, etc. off the table before the robot comes over to sweep/wipe down the table.</p>

        <!-- SECOND PROJECT -->

        <h2>Tennis Ball Robot:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://bow-tie-bot.tumblr.com/post/169670407189/storyboard">Sketch &amp; Storyboard</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://bow-tie-bot.tumblr.com/post/169669228609/lean-canvas">Lean Canvas</a></p>

        <h3>What do we like about the project?</h3>
        <p>The robot will solve a time and effort problem that is faced in tennis training schools, where players or employees are spending too much time and energy picking up the balls during the training.</p>
        <p>The storyboard demonstrated that purpose very well. It was clear and easy to understand. </p>

        <h3>What are potential issues with the project?</h3>
        <p>The Lean canvas mentions this project as the first in the field, but there are <a href="http://www.tennibot.com/" target="_blank">existing similar products</a> that are being commercialized. However, this is a good indicator of the existence of an established market for this product.</p>
        <p>Object recognition and localization can be challenging to implement, especially if the robot has to do the object localization for the whole court at once. </p>
        <p>Removing the tennis net is not necessary, since the process can be repeated for each side of the court, which will reduce the human intervention needed.</p>
        <p>People can interfere with the recognition and localization process if the court is not empty.</p>
        <p>The carried basket may represent some challenges, it needs to be big enough to hold a large number of balls. Because of its weight, it needs to be attached tightly enough to the robot, and at the same time be flexible enough for the robot to empty it or just replace it with an empty basket.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions to Resolve Issues</h3>
        <p>The object recognition can be continuous where the robot keeps looking for the balls that were not initially localized.</p>
        <p>The carried basket can be mounted on wheels and replaced by an empty basket each time it is full or all the balls have been collected.</p>
