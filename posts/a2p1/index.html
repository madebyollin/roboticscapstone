        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Our team members are <strong>Ghada</strong>, <strong>Kennan</strong>, <strong>Kevin</strong>, <strong>Ollin</strong>, and <strong>Yifan</strong>. We're team #3.</p>
        <h2>Our Blog</h2>
        <p>...is this one!</p>
        <h2>Our Top Two Project Ideas</h2>
        <p>After reviewing the <a href="https://cse481wi18news.tumblr.com/post/169589352144/top-startup-ideas-2018">suggested startup ideas</a>, we decided on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://shadyrobots.tumblr.com/post/169483481205/startup-idea-navigation-assistance">Seeing Eye Bot</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://cse481.tumblr.com/post/169484421846/startup-idea-pickup-bot">Pickup Bot</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We completed the following Lean Canvases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Seeing Eye Bot.pdf" target="_blank">Seeing Eye Bot</a></li>
            <li><a href="Trash Bot.pdf" target="_blank">Pickup Bot</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both projects had potential.  In particular:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            The Pickup Bot would be easier to commercialize–it has a larger number of potential customers. We could also partner with other companies commercializing similar products (like Roomba). The implementation of this project could also potentially be easier, since it doesn't need to be as fast or friendly to interact with.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the other hand, the navigation assistant is targeting a more important and complex issue. Many modern research projects are related to accessibility and assistive technologies, and the discipline of robotics offers unique ways improve accessibility. We were also interested in the potential for more advanced features, like face recognition and tactile reactions in the arm.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p>Based on the canvases and our discussion of the above tradeoffs, we decided to go with the <strong>Seeing Eye Bot</strong> as our team's project.</p>
